title: "Phase 4: Analytics Dashboard"
description: Interactive prototype of insights and closed-loop learning dashboard
---

import Analytics from '../../../components/prototypes/Analytics.jsx';

This prototype demonstrates the **Phase 4** analytics dashboard - intelligent insights and closed-loop learning.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Summary Statistics** - Key metrics with trends
- **AI-Generated Insights** - Pattern detection and suggestions
- **Issue Distribution** - By plane with change indicators
- **Customer Health** - Status and trend per customer
- **Documentation Effectiveness** - Which docs actually help
- **Duplicate Detection** - Similar issue finder
- **Common Patterns** - Recurring issue types with resolutions

## Try It Out

Explore the dashboard to see different analytics views and AI insights.

<div className="not-content" style={{ background: 'white', borderRadius: '12px', padding: '0', margin: '1rem 0', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <Analytics client:load />
</div>

## Design Notes

### Summary Statistics

Four key metrics at top:
- **Total Issues** - Overall volume with trend
- **Open Issues** - Current backlog
- **Resolved This Month** - Team productivity
- **Avg Resolution Time** - Efficiency metric

Each card shows:
- Value (large, prominent)
- Trend indicator (↑↓ with percentage)
- Color coding (green=good, red=attention)

### AI-Generated Insights

Three insight types:

**Pattern Detection (Orange):**
- Identifies spikes in issue types
- Shows affected issue IDs
- Suggests documentation actions

**Documentation Gaps (Blue):**
- Issues with no helpful docs
- Candidates for new content
- Links to related existing docs

**Positive Trends (Green):**
- Improvements to celebrate
- Attribution to actions taken
- Suggestions to replicate success

### Issue Distribution by Plane

Horizontal bar chart:
- Color-coded by plane
- Shows count and % change
- Visual comparison of volume

### Customer Health

Per-customer cards showing:
- Open issue count
- Critical issues (red if > 0)
- Average resolution time
- Trend direction
- Status badge (Healthy/Warning)

### Documentation Effectiveness

Table of docs with:
- Views (total impressions)
- Helpful marks (positive feedback)
- Effectiveness ratio (helpful/views)
- Progress bar visualization
- Trend indicator

**Thresholds:**
- > 30% = Green (effective)
- 15-30% = Yellow (needs review)
- < 15% = Red (rewrite candidate)

### Duplicate Detection

When analyzing new issue:
- Shows similar past issues
- Similarity percentage
- Status (resolved/in-progress)
- Resolution notes if available
- "Link to this issue" action

### Common Patterns

Recurring issue types:
- Pattern name and frequency
- Associated plane
- Average resolution time
- Common resolution text

## Implementation Notes

When building V1:

### Analytics Queries

```typescript
// Summary stats
const summary = await db.query.issues.findMany({
  where: gte(issues.createdAt, startOfMonth),
});

// Plane distribution
const distribution = await db
  .select({
    plane: planes.name,
    count: count()
  })
  .from(issues)
  .leftJoin(planes, eq(issues.primaryPlaneId, planes.id))
  .groupBy(planes.name);

// Doc effectiveness
const effectiveness = await db
  .select({
    docUrl: docFeedback.docUrl,
    views: count(),
    helpful: count().filter(docFeedback.markedHelpful)
  })
  .from(docFeedback)
  .groupBy(docFeedback.docUrl);
```

### AI Insights Generation

Run nightly job to:
1. Aggregate issue patterns
2. Compare to previous period
3. Generate insights via Claude
4. Store for dashboard display

```typescript
const insights = await generateInsights({
  recentIssues: last7Days,
  docFeedback: last30Days,
  customerMetrics: current
});
```

### Duplicate Detection

Use vector similarity:
```typescript
const embedding = await generateEmbedding(newIssue.description);
const similar = await vectorSearch(embedding, {
  table: 'issues',
  threshold: 0.75,
  limit: 5
});
```

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Self-resolution rate | 25%+ |
| Duplicate reduction | 50% |
| Actionable insights/week | 5+ |
| Team action on insights | 60% |

## UX Considerations

### Progressive Disclosure

- Summary cards first (quick glance)
- Details on scroll/click
- Deep dives in separate views

### Actionable Focus

- Every insight has a suggested action
- Clear next steps
- Links to relevant resources

### Real-time vs. Cached

- Summary stats: Cached (refreshed hourly)
- Duplicate detection: Real-time
- Insights: Daily generation
