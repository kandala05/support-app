title: "Phase 3: Conversational AI"
description: Interactive prototype of AI-powered chat interface for issue creation
---

import Conversational from '../../../components/prototypes/Conversational.jsx';

This prototype demonstrates the **Phase 3** conversational AI interface - a chat-based alternative to the structured form.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Mode Selection** - Choose between Form and Chat
- **Natural Language Input** - Describe issues conversationally
- **AI Follow-ups** - Smart questions to gather context
- **Embedded Doc Snippets** - Relevant docs in chat responses
- **Auto-Categorization** - AI suggests plane/context
- **Issue Preview** - Structured data extracted for review

## Try It Out

1. Select **"Conversational AI"** mode
2. Try typing: "My deployment keeps timing out"
3. Follow the AI's prompts
4. See how it extracts structured data

<div className="not-content" style={{ background: 'white', borderRadius: '12px', padding: '0', margin: '1rem 0', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <Conversational client:load />
</div>

## Design Notes

### Mode Selection Screen

- Clear choice between Form and Chat
- Benefits listed for each option
- "NEW" badge on Chat to encourage exploration
- Equal visual weight (no forced default)

### Chat Interface

**Header:**
- AI assistant avatar with gradient
- Name and description
- Back button to mode selection

**Messages:**
- User messages (dark, right-aligned)
- AI messages (light, left-aligned)
- Timestamps for context

**Typing Indicator:**
- Animated dots during AI "thinking"
- Provides feedback during wait

### Embedded Components

**Doc Snippets:**
- Appear inline in AI responses
- Categorized by Diataxis type
- Expandable with link to full article

**AI Suggestions:**
- Blue card with extracted fields
- "Looks good" / "Let me edit" actions
- Confidence indication

**Issue Preview:**
- Green card when ready to submit
- All extracted fields shown
- Single submit button

### Conversation Flow

```
1. User describes issue naturally
   ↓
2. AI responds with relevant docs + questions
   ↓
3. User provides context (customer, env)
   ↓
4. AI suggests categorization
   ↓
5. User confirms or edits
   ↓
6. AI shows issue preview
   ↓
7. User submits
```

## Implementation Notes

When building V1:

1. Use Vercel AI SDK with `useChat` hook
2. Implement `/api/chat` streaming endpoint
3. Configure Claude with tool calling:
   - `searchDocs` - Find relevant documentation
   - `categorize` - Suggest plane/context
   - `findDuplicates` - Check for similar issues
4. Use `streamUI` for custom components

### Tool Definitions

```typescript
const tools = {
  searchDocs: {
    description: "Search documentation for relevant articles",
    parameters: z.object({
      query: z.string(),
      planeSlug: z.string().optional()
    }),
    execute: async ({ query, planeSlug }) => {
      return await searchDocumentation(query, planeSlug);
    }
  },
  categorize: {
    description: "Suggest issue categorization",
    parameters: z.object({
      description: z.string(),
      context: z.object({
        customer: z.string().optional(),
        environment: z.string().optional()
      })
    }),
    execute: async ({ description, context }) => {
      // AI determines plane/context from description
      return suggestCategory(description, context);
    }
  }
};
```

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Chat mode adoption | 40%+ |
| Faster than form | 20%+ |
| Categorization accuracy | 85%+ |

## UX Considerations

### Not Mandatory

- Users can always choose form
- Chat is an alternative, not replacement
- Both produce same structured output

### Graceful Fallback

- If AI fails, prompt to use form
- Don't block issue submission
- Human review before final submit

### Conversation State

- State persists during session
- Can go back to mode selection
- Clear when issue submitted
