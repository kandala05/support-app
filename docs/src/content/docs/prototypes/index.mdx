title: Interactive Prototypes
description: Try the Support App features interactively before they're built
---

These interactive prototypes demonstrate the planned UX for each phase of Support App. They use mock data and run entirely in your browser.

## Why Prototypes?

Instead of static wireframes, we embed **working React components** that:

- Show realistic interactions
- Use representative mock data
- Communicate design intent clearly
- Can be lifted to production code

## Available Prototypes

### [Phase 1: Issue Submission](/support-app/prototypes/phase1-basic/)

The foundation - a multi-step form for structured issue capture.

**Features demonstrated:**
- Customer/environment selection
- Plane categorization
- Context-specific fields
- Form validation
- Review and submit

### [Phase 2: Smart Documentation Sidebar](/support-app/prototypes/phase2-smart/)

Real-time documentation suggestions as users type.

**Features demonstrated:**
- Live search as you type
- Diataxis-categorized results
- Relevance scoring
- "Mark as helpful" feedback
- Doc snippets with links

### [Phase 3: Conversational AI](/support-app/prototypes/phase3-chat/)

Chat-based issue creation with AI assistance.

**Features demonstrated:**
- Mode selection (Form vs Chat)
- Natural language input
- AI follow-up questions
- Embedded doc snippets
- Auto-categorization suggestions

### [Phase 4: Analytics Dashboard](/support-app/prototypes/phase4-analytics/)

Insights and closed-loop learning.

**Features demonstrated:**
- Summary statistics
- Issue distribution charts
- Customer health scores
- AI-generated insights
- Documentation effectiveness
- Duplicate detection

## How to Use

1. Click on a prototype above
2. Interact with the interface
3. Notice the UX patterns and flows
4. Provide feedback to the team

## Technical Notes

- Prototypes are React components with `client:load`
- All data is mocked/hardcoded
- No backend calls are made
- State resets on page refresh

## Providing Feedback

After exploring prototypes, share feedback:

1. **UX Flow** - Does the flow make sense?
2. **Missing Features** - What's not shown that should be?
3. **Confusion Points** - Where might users get stuck?
4. **Visual Design** - Suggestions for styling?

Create an issue or discuss in the team channel.
