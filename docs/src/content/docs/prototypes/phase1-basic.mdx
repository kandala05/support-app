title: "Phase 1: Issue Submission"
description: Interactive prototype of the multi-step issue submission form
---

import IssueSubmission from '../../../components/prototypes/IssueSubmission.jsx';

This prototype demonstrates the **Phase 1** issue submission form - a multi-step wizard for capturing structured issue data.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Step 1: Context** - Customer and environment selection
- **Step 2: Category** - Plane selection (primary + secondary)
- **Step 3: Details** - Title, description, context fields
- **Step 4: Review** - Confirmation before submission

## Try It Out

<div className="not-content" style={{ background: 'white', borderRadius: '12px', padding: '0', margin: '1rem 0', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <IssueSubmission client:load />
</div>

## Design Notes

### Multi-Step Wizard

Breaking the form into steps:
- Reduces cognitive load
- Enables dynamic filtering (customer → environments)
- Provides clear progress indication
- Allows review before submission

### Customer/Environment Selection

- Grid layout for visual selection
- Environment type badges (dev/qa/staging/prod)
- Filtered based on customer selection

### Plane Selection

- Card-based selection with icons
- Color-coded gradients per plane
- Primary plane required, secondary optional
- Visual hierarchy distinguishes primary vs secondary

### Context Fields

Dynamic fields based on plane:
- **App CI/CD**: Pipeline Stage dropdown
- **EKS**: Component dropdown
- Other planes: May have different contexts

### Form Validation

- Required fields clearly marked
- Validation before allowing progression
- Disabled "Continue" until requirements met

### Review Step

- Read-only summary of all fields
- Organized by section (Context, Platform Area, Details)
- Clear submit action

## Implementation Notes

When building V1:

1. Replace mock customer/environment data with API calls
2. Add authentication (Cognito)
3. Implement `/api/issues` POST endpoint
4. Store in PostgreSQL via Drizzle
5. Generate issue ID (ISS-YYYY-NNNN format)
6. Add success notification

## UX Considerations

### Progressive Disclosure

- Only show relevant fields
- Hide secondary options until primary selected
- Expand details as user progresses

### Error Prevention

- Validate inline before submission
- Clear error messages
- Highlight problematic fields

### Mobile Responsiveness

- Cards stack vertically on mobile
- Form fields full-width
- Buttons easily tappable
